Hello and welcome to the security section. To get started, I'd like to set some ground rules and tips for the project I've made.

1. Use with caution - Running the script could cause issues with your PC, including hardware problems or hard disk damage.
2. Only use the script on your own PC - As I mentioned earlier, the script could cause hardware issues, so running it to someone else's computer isn't a really good idea.
3. Make sure to use a compiler - To run the script you need a compiler. I'd recommend MinGW or Visual Studio for C++ and .NET SDK for C#.

"How long does it take to fix an issue?"

Usually, fixing an issue can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. If you encountered an issue, please mention it in the issues tab and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.

"How long does it take to port the script to a different language or a different OS?"

Porting the script to a different language usually takes a few hours, but porting it to a different OS could take at least a day. I'm most familiar with Windows, so trying to make something for a different OS could be quite difficult.

That's it for now. Thank you for reading and enjoy the script!
