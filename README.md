A C# script that automatically shuts down Windows computers with zero warnings or prompts. Uses the Windows shutdown command to force-close all applications and immediately power off the system. Requires administrator privileges to execute the forced shutdown. Use with caution.

As of right now, the script is only available on Windows, written with C#. More languages will be available soon, as well as a Linux version. Thank you for reading!
