CAUTION: This command is still in its pre-release, meaning it's unstable and can lead to severe hardware damage. Use at your own risk!

The first command is "Manual Shutdown". Once you run the command, it'll ask you if you want to shutdown your PC. Click (Yes) if you want to shutdown your PC, and (No) if you don't want to do it.

The second commant is "Force Shutdown", which means after you ran it, it'll automatically shut down your PC, no matter what you do. This one is really unstable, so use it at your own risk.

Thank you for reading.
